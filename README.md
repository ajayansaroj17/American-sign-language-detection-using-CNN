ASL provides the deaf community a way to interact within the community itself as well as with the outside world. However, not everyone knows about signs and gestures used in sign language. With the advent of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning, it is now possible to build a system that can recognize objects or even objects of various categories. The Kaggle ASL alphabet dataset was used to develop the CNN model, which has an 82% classification accuracy. The neural network is built using the Tensorflow framework, with CNN layers added initially and ANN layers added after.
